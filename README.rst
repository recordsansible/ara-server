ara-django
==========

.. image:: doc/source/_static/screenshot.png

An experiment with Django at the core of the ARA 1.0 backend.
This is not stable or production-ready.

If you are looking for ARA Records Ansible, the Ansible callback plugin and
reporting interface, you will find the repository here_.

We are prototyping outside the main repository due to the vast changes
involved and will merge back as appropriate.

Documentation
=============

*Work in progress*

This is python3 only right now.

**TL;DR**: Using tox is convenient for the time being::

  # Use the source Luke
  git clone https://github.com/openstack/ara-server
  cd ara-server

  # Install tox
  pip install tox # (or the tox python library from your distro packages)

  # Create data from a test playbook and callback
  tox -e ansible-playbook

  # Run test server -> http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/v1/
  tox -e runserver

  # Run actual tests or get coverage
  tox -e pep8
  tox -e py3
  tox -e cover

  # Build docs
  tox -e docs

See the ``hacking`` directory for testing resources.
